Code:
    [ ] test all on CPU + check resume
    [ ] test all on GPU

    [ ] generate.py => use plugins there
    [ ] easy test conditional -> get_data, run_model
    [ ] runner script => update defaults.yml and note that it is overridden by conf_file
    [ ] use the validation result! (5 bad results after warm_up + bad D_loss for 20 + bad G_loss after 20)
    [ ] alish features => call matlab with .mat args

Configs:
    Loss:
        optimizer: adam, amsgrad, ttur
        hinge
        wgan_gp + ct
        wgan_theirs + ct
        num_epochs + transition + train
    Structure:
        progress: num layers, initial size, depth_manager_offset, progression_scale
        channel by channel
        stats layer

        residual
