MISC:
handle class conditioning data, generator, discriminator, inference
output the attention map for visiualization

plugin:
SWD :: graph per size per time => check their code
MS-SSIM :: grpah per time => check their code
for generation, use a exp moving average of G for more stable results! (0.999)
picture: top_generated, bottom 5 nearest neighbors in feature_space of D / feature_space of Inception / MSE
add validation dataset to evaluate accuracy of D over time (combat memorization)

checking:
check weight initialization of CNNs
check their code for other hidden gems
