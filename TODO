#PGGAN
SWD :: graph per size per time
MS-SSIM :: grpah per time
wgan-gp: ||grad-lambda||/lambda^2, lambda = 1 and 750!
baseline: batch normalization in the generator, layer normalization in the discriminator
last layer of G is linear
leaky in both, alpha=0.2
for generation, use a exp moving average of G for more stable results! (0.999)
disc_loss: e_drift * E(D(x)^2 for x is real) , e_drift = 0.001
n_critic=1
+ they did not use dropout at all
picture: top_generated, bottom 5 nearest neighbors in feature_space of D / feature_space of Inception / MSE
