TODO:
    test everything on GPU
    verbose mode with backward(loss calculation)
    connection network with a D like arch
    our_baseline: num_params + lr + batch_size + scheduler
    their_baseline: read the paper again
    morph code: both for static/dynamic and connection_based/not
    position encoding generator: where?(use dm_offset?) + forward/backward?
    conv discriminator
    gang of D: how to balance loss over time?
    condition: dataset, data_reader, evaluation
    hinge and spectral norm: stable config(baseline)
    kernel_size: 3, 5, 7, 9
    wgan: orig, theirs x ct/not
    stats layer: temporal, num_channels, cnn
    num features: 2048, 512, same, ...
    dropout: mode, strength x G/D
    norm: pixel, batch, layer, none
    wnorm: spectral, weight, none
    shapes: initial size, seq len, depth_offset
    validation: kill based on validation
