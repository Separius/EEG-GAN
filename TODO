Code:
    [ ] connection network => change D
    [ ] F(o1, o2, o3) = o4 => change G => + runner script
    [ ] Z1,0,0,0,Z2,0,0,0,Z3 => change G => Compatibility Network([Con(real1), Con(real2)] = high) -> + runner script => make it end to end
    [ ] test all on CPU + check resume
    [ ] test all on GPU
    [ ] gang of D?
Eval:
    seeing => generate.py => use plugins there
    alish features => call matlab with .mat args
    easy test conditional
    runner script => update defaults.yml and make sure it is overridden by given params
    use the validation result! (5 bad results after warm_up + bad D_loss for 20 + bad G_loss after 20)
