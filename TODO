condition:
    handle class conditioning data, generator, discriminator, inference
    instead of bn(w=emb_l(y)); bn(w=linear_l(emb(y))||z_l) -> make sure zero centerd and one centred
attention:
    output the attention map for visiualization
    spectral norm in all the attention: BTC -> q=(BTC/8), k=(BT/2C/8)[maxpooling after conv] [no act in convs] v=(BT/2C/2) -> conv(att(q,k)*v) BTC * gamma + x
plugin:
    picture: top_generated, bottom 5 nearest neighbors in feature_space of D / feature_space of Inception / MSE
    gif(z1 -> z2)
    gif(const_z over epochs)
    imaginary fid, imaginary inception score
    * SWD :: graph per size per time + plugins.py:365
    * add validation dataset to evaluate accuracy of D over time (combat memorization)
        * do something better than printing with these results
Z:
    uses different z chunks for different layers [for each block, uses the same z_chunk]
sampling:
    https://github.com/shinseung428/DRS_Tensorflow
    truncation_tirck (of norm(z) > threshold, resample)
biggan:
    increase batch size
    increase number of channels by 50%
    orthogonal_reqularization on G weights
    2 d iters, 5e-5 lr for G and 2e-4 for D; adam (0, 0.999)
    monitor max singular value of weights
    batch norm (cond or not) + D == bad
failed section: qrnn, tcn, dilated rnn, sru, sample rnn, wavenet, ae, vae
exp:
    train arl-eeg on a subset
    plot the loss values
    aggregation graphs (like the eeg paper)
    condition interpolation * Z(*chunks) interpolation
    D(x) as supervised weight
    connection net F(D_intermediate(x)) = z
    dumb length extension(+ intermediate concatenation)
    dumb selected sampling(based on D value)
    "one in the batch" conditioning
    240Hz
    more channels
    multi-conditioning
    unk one hot or multi hot of options / n
    FID-IS AuC for truncation trick
    G_1(Z) = o1, o2, o3, o4 -> F(o1,o2,o3) = o4
