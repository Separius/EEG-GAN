Low Freq & Seq Length(Hard):
    progressive  dilated RNN :: Z(2xFreq)|NewLayer|OldLayer|Fake ; Data(2xFreq)|NewLayer|OldLayer|Pred
    progressive Wavenet
    self attention :: AddToWhichLayer&When?
Multi Channel:
    Gang Mode
    Increase to 16 channels
    Channel Embedding(generator, discriminator)
Validation:
    show that Disc(concatenated parts) == fake
    train on real test on fake (abnormal / 6 classes / seizure)
    train on fake test on real
    Connection Network (restore Z from data ||z-C(D(z))|| )
    use the easy classifier(validation) results for both D and (G, D)
