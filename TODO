Addition:
    experiment manager and hyper param search(Define ParamSearchSpace)
    Test DRNN models(+ make slerp work here too [gif generator/fixed explicitly says use this])

    chrononet network
    5 types of conditional nets

Validation:
    Alish Features
    d(concatenated parts) == fake
    3-way mmd over fft or time
    Use validation result
    Aggregation graphs (time and freq domain)
    16 channels
    higher top freq(250 Hz)
Classification:

Experiment:
    test on audio(use sample rnn script)
    connection network
    differential privacy training
    sample-rnn + trained discriminator + classifier hidden rep
    Recurrent => recurrent layers with a lipschitz regularizers(read the SN paper + orthogonal rnns)
    progressive dilated mode + AutoRegressive
Condition:
    ConditionalBatchNorm
    On:
        User Embedding
        Easy meta-data(age, sex)
        All the data
    Loss:
        SemiSupervised InfoGAN(github.com/spurra/ss-infogan)
        AcGan(github.com/znxlwm/pytorch-generative-model-collections/blob/master/ACGAN.py)
        Activation Maximization(github.com/ZhimingZhou/AM-GAN)
        Class Splitting GAN(github.com/CIFASIS/splitting_gan)
        Projection(yW . x)(github.com/pfnet-research/sngan_projection)
InfiniteSeqLen:
    Freez D and swap first linear of G with a conv => not consistent => must defreeze D and retrain everything
    Mabye, giving 0,0,0,Z,0,0,0,Z,0,0,0,Z,0,0,0 will work? => middle outputs must be halved => is not consistent even with slerp
    G1(z)=o1,o2,o3,o4 so we can have a F(o1,o2,o3)=o4 and H(o2,o3,o4)=o1 + DropOut => extend this is VAE like output
    Use the connection net to make another gan over sequences of Z! :D
